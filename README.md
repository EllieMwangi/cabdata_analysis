# cabdata_analysis
A descriptive analysis report that investigates the various patterns on how pricing works for existing ride sharing companies.

## Overview
Over the past few years, ride sharing apps have been on the rise across many cities in the world. While this has happened, Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. The objective of analysis is to try and identify patterns and factors that influence pricing such as time of day, weather conditions etc.

The data used for analysis was obtained from the Uber & Lyft cab prices data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices). The cab ride data covers various types of cabs for Uber & Lyft and their price for the given location. Weather data contains weather attributes like temperature, rain, cloud, etc for all the locations taken into consideration.
